#### Authors: Wai Cheong Tsoi, Kenneth Dano, Shane Blim

This repository hosts the hardware and software code for a hardware chess engine 
integrated into Tom Kerrigan's _Tom Kerrigan's Simple Chess Program (TSCP)_. This 
was created during the Winter and Spring Quarter 2020 in UC Davis for the Capstone 
Project Course of EEC181AB. A report of the end result is included as 
[Report.pdf](https://github.com/Tony-Tsoi/EEC181_Chess/blob/master/Report.pdf).
